# /buildflow-debug

Systematic root-cause analysis for failing tests, broken builds, or unexpected behavior. The Surgeon reads the error, traces it to the source, and fixes it with minimal footprint.

## Usage
- `/buildflow-debug` — debug the most recent failure
- `/buildflow-debug "error message or description"`
- `/buildflow-debug src/auth/login.ts` — debug a specific file
- `/buildflow-debug --trace` — full stack trace analysis

## Step 1: Collect the Error
If a description was passed, use it.
Otherwise check for recent failure context:
- Last test run output
- Browser console errors
- Terminal error logs
- `.buildflow/phases/[N]/PLAN.md` for what was expected

## Step 2: Reproduce the Failure
- Run the failing test or trigger the failing flow
- Confirm the error is reproducible before investigating
- Note: exact error message, file, line number, stack trace

## Step 3: Trace to Root Cause
Work backwards from the symptom:
1. What line threw the error?
2. What called that line?
3. What data was passed in?
4. Where does that data come from?
5. What assumption is violated?

Distinguish:
- **Symptom** — where the error surfaces
- **Root cause** — where the actual problem is

## Step 4: Impact Check
Before fixing:
- How many places does this root cause affect?
- Is this a one-off bug or a systemic pattern?
- Will fixing this break anything else?

## Step 5: Create Restore Point
```bash
git stash  # safe fallback before making changes
```

## Step 6: Apply Fix
- Fix only the root cause, not the symptom
- Minimum footprint — do not refactor surrounding code
- Match existing code style (PATTERNS.md)

## Step 7: Verify Fix
- Re-run the failing test — confirm it passes
- Run full test suite — confirm no regressions
- If UI bug: verify the flow works end-to-end

## Step 8: Prevent Recurrence
- Add a test that would have caught this bug
- Note the fix in `.buildflow/learnings/decisions.md` if it reveals a systemic issue

## Token cost report (print at end of debug)

Measure actual cost before printing:
1. Sum character counts of all Context Packet files loaded ÷ 4 = input tokens
2. Estimate output from text generated ÷ 4 = output tokens
3. Update `state.md → session_tokens_used` by adding this command's cost

Default output (minimal):
```
Debug complete — root cause: [description] · fix applied: [yes/no]
Session: ~[N]K tokens
```

Verbose output (only if `verbose_context: true` in preferences.md):
```
Token Cost — /buildflow-debug
──────────────────────────────
Context loaded:    ~[N]K tokens
Output generated:  ~[N]K tokens
This command:      ~[N]K tokens
Session total:     ~[N]K tokens   (since [session_start])
```

## Guided Next Step

```
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
→ Next:  /buildflow-test
   Why:  Fix applied — re-run tests to confirm the root cause is resolved
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
Session: ~[N]K tokens
```

If root cause could not be isolated: `→ Next: /buildflow-debug` (re-run with a narrower hypothesis).
If the bug traced to a spec gap: `→ Next: /buildflow-spec --review` (amend the AC before proceeding).

## Token Budget: ~20K
